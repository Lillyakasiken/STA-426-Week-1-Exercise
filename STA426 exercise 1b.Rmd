# Set seed

In order to reproduce the following results.
```{r}
set.seed(1024)
```


# Log-normal distribution
Samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25)
```{r}
log_norm_samples <- rlnorm(n = 100L, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```


# Histogram
Create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale
```{r}
histogram <- hist(log_norm_samples, breaks = 20, col = "lightcyan3")
log_scale <- hist(log(log_norm_samples), breaks = 20, col = "lightblue3")
```

# Mean and variance
Report the mean and variance of the sample
```{r}
mean(log_norm_samples)
var(log_norm_samples)
```
The mean of the sample is 2.78661 and the variance is 0.4876358
